        <p>PufferLib is a great RL library that makes RL just work.</p>

                <p>This tutorial contains everything you need to start doing RL 100x faster than most of the field. We also highly encourage you to read the PufferLib source. It's not like other RL libraries: PufferLib does what it does in a few thousand lines of very simple code. It is also much easier to get help when you're stuck. Our <a href="https://discord.gg/puffer" target="_blank">Discord</a> community is active and helpful.</p>
